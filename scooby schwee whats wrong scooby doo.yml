  (speaking Japanese, English subtitles)
  Lain: "What's wrong?"
  Other: "It's nothing. Forget about it."
  The other character walks away up a set of stairs.
  Lain turns to see Scooby Doo sitting on the ground.
  Scooby Doo transforms into a car while saying "A-schweee".
  Shaggy hops into the car, and it drives off the right of the frame.
  Cut to Lain looking slightly surprised.
