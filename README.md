# encyclopedia-radica
A categorization of things I find interesting.

According to Wikipedia and Google Translate, Radica means "root", which is a happy coincidence since I want the name to match Raddest.

## What is it?

Have you ever thought of a meme, song, or some other _thing_ that you could describe, but not find online?  
With Encyclopedia Radica, you can categorize what is important to you.  
You can discover what is important to you.  
You can _view_ what is important to you.

People always say: "once it's on the internet, it's available forever".  
I want to make this true.
